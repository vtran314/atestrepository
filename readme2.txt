AWCWD has multiple opportunities and is currently recruiting Interns and Summer Interns for both the China Lake and Point Mugu sites. 
Incumbents must be United States citizens and must be able to obtain and maintain a Secret clearance.
Internship Programs
NAWCWD uses the STEM Student Employment Program (SSEP) for students who are pursuing S&E degrees in fields that will lead to the 
Engineer and Scientist Development Program (ESDP) upon graduation and degree conferral. All other intern hiring is handled through
the Pathways Intern Program. These programs offer three components: Summer Interns (Not to Exceed one year), Interns (Flexible Term or Perma
nent), and Apprentice Interns (Permanent). The intern programs are available to all levels of students: high school, vocational, technical, 
associate, baccalaureate, graduate, and doctorate.
